" Presented at PyCon APAC 2012

" Automatic reloading of .vimrc
autocmd! bufwritepost .vimrc source %


" Better copy & paste
" When you want to paste large blocks of code into vim, press F2 before you
" paste. At the bottom you should see ``-- INSERT (paste) --``.

set pastetoggle=<F2>
set clipboard=unnamed


" Mouse and backspace
set mouse=a  " on OSX press ALT and click
set bs=2     " make backspace behave like normal again


" Rebind <Leader> key
" I like to have it here becuase it is easier to reach than the default and
" it is next to ``m`` and ``n`` which I use for navigating between tabs.
let mapleader = ","


" Bind nohl
" Removes highlight of your last search
" ``<C>`` stands for ``CTRL`` and therefore ``<C-n>`` stands for ``CTRL+n``
noremap <C-n> :nohl<CR>
vnoremap <C-n> :nohl<CR>
inoremap <C-n> :nohl<CR>


" bind Ctrl+<movement> keys to move around the windows, instead of using Ctrl+w + <movement>
" Every unnecessary keystroke that can be saved is good for your health :)
map <c-j> <c-w>j
map <c-k> <c-w>k
map <c-l> <c-w>l
map <c-h> <c-w>h


" easier moving between tabs
map <Leader>n <esc>:tabprevious<CR>
map <Leader>m <esc>:tabnext<CR>


" map sort function to a key
vnoremap <Leader>s :sort<CR>


" easier moving of code blocks
" Try to go into visual mode (v), thenselect several lines of code here and
" then press ``>`` several times.
vnoremap < <gv  " better indentation
vnoremap > >gv  " better indentation


" Show whitespace
" MUST be inserted BEFORE the colorscheme command
autocmd ColorScheme * highlight ExtraWhitespace ctermbg=red guibg=red
au InsertLeave * match ExtraWhitespace /\s\+$/


" Color scheme
" mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors && cd ~/.vim/colors
" wget -O wombat256mod.vim http://www.vim.org/scripts/download_script.php?src_id=13400
set t_Co=256
color wombat256mod


" Enable syntax highlighting
" You need to reload this file for the change to apply
filetype off
filetype plugin indent on
syntax on


" Showing line numbers and length
set number  " show line numbers
set tw=79   " width of document (used by gd)
set nowrap  " don't automatically wrap on load
set fo-=t   " don't automatically wrap text when typing
set colorcolumn=80

set history=700

" Real programmers don't use TABs but spaces
set tabstop=4

" Make search case insensitive, actually not
set hlsearch
set incsearch
" set ignorecase

" Disable stupid backup and swap files - they trigger too many events
" for file system watchers
